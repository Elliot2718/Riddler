    "# Riddler: Fibonacci at the Post Office\n",

    "\n",
    "_A postal worker and his customer joke about the various ways the customer could mathematically encode her post office box number. The customer realizes that every integer greater than 1 can be encoded via at least one Fibonacci-like sequence using an ordered triple (m, n, q). The encoded number is the qth member of the sequence after the first two positive integers m and n, where each term is the sum of the previous two terms. For example, 7 has the encodings (3, 4, 1) and (1, 3, 2). In an attempt to stump the postal worker, the customer prefers encodings with a maximal value of q. What encoding should she use for the number 81? **Extra credit:** What encoding should she use for the number 179?_"

    "The hard part of this problem will be determining how we know that we have the maximal value of q. It's clear that the minimal solution for a given number N is always 1. That is, the tuple (1, N-1, 1), i.e. the sequence 1, N-1, N, ..., always works. But given a solution, how do we know it is maximal? That is not immediately obvious to me, besides that n and m should be as small as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "My first thought is to go with a brute force solution. That is, for a number N (e.g. 81) generate all possible sequences with m,n < N, find all sequences that contain the number N and find the sequence with maximal q. This honestly seems a bit boring. Surely there is a slicker solution. I spent some time working on this problem on paper, trying to find something, but I didn't figure anything out ðŸ˜¢.\n",
    "\n",
    "### But wait!\n",
    "Ok, I did figure one thing out on paper that may make the brute force solution more efficient. After writing down some sequences, I noticed that a sequence defined by (m, n) can be written as the linear combination of two Fibonacci sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lemma**: Let $m, n$ be positive integers. Then each Fibonacci-like sequence $G_q$ defined recursively as $G_1=m, G_2=n$ and $G_q=G_q+G_{q+1}$ can be written as a linear combination the Fibonacci sequence $F_q$ as $G_q = mF_{q-3}+nF_{q-2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof**: We can prove this inductively.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Base Case_: We have previously defined $G_3=m+n,F_1=1$ and $F_2=1$. Therefore, $mF_1+nF_2=m+n=G_3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Induction_: Suppose that $G_q = mF_{q-3}+nF_{q-2}$ and $G_{q-1}=mF_{q-4}+nF_{q-3}$. Then,\n",

    "\\begin{equation} \\label{eq1}\n",

    "G_{q+1} & = G_q+G_{q-1} \\\\\n",

    "& = m(F_{q-3}+F_{q-4}) + n(F_{q-2}+F_{q-3}) \\\\\n",
    "& = mF_{q-2}+nF_{q-1}\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",

    "which completes the proof. $\\blacksquare$\n",
    "\n",
    "So what does that get us? This means that for a given number N, we only need to generate the Fibonacci sequence, and then we can generate all possible Fibonacci-like sequences by simple multiplication. Let's try it!"
